I am a postdoc in the School of Civil & Environmental Engineering at Georgia Tech. My research focuses on emerging mobility services and technology, and I am particularly interested in their implications to environmental sustainability and mobility of the disadvantaged population. I have rich experience in teaching GIS and quantitative method courses, and recently I taught [open-source GIS with `R`](https://rpubs.com/spring19cp6521) and [data visualization with Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/yongsung.lee#!/).
